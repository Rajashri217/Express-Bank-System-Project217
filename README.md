Summary:
The Express Banking System project aims to develop a secure, efficient, and user-friendly banking 
application using JavaScript. The system is designed to manage bank accounts, facilitate money 
transfers, and simplify the account creation process. By leveraging linear and non-linear data 
structures along with basic algorithms, the project enhances understanding of JavaScript and its 
practical applications in data management.
Description
Problem Statement and Motivation
In an era where manual banking operations are becoming increasingly inefficient and error-prone, 
there is a pressing need for a computerized solution. Traditional methods of managing accounts and 
transactions are often time-consuming and lack the scalability and security required in modern 
banking environments. The Express Banking System is developed to address these challenges, 
offering a solution that improves efficiency, accuracy, and overall customer service.
Industry Relevance
1. JavaScript: A versatile programming language used extensively for creating interactive web 
applications.
2. Data Structures: These are essential for organizing and managing data efficiently. Linear 
structures like arrays and linked lists, and non-linear structures such as trees, are 
fundamental in the development of robust applications.
3. Algorithms: Defined procedures for data processing and computational tasks are crucial for 
implementing effective and efficient functionality.
Project Tasks
1. Setup Tools and Libraries: Begin by establishing the Node.js environment, which provides 
the runtime for executing JavaScript code server-side. This involves setting up necessary 
libraries and tools for development.
2. Develop Data Structures: Implement core data structures:
o Node: Represents a basic unit in a data structure, such as a linked list.
o LinkedList: Manages a sequence of nodes, useful for storing and manipulating 
account data dynamically.
o TreeNode: Utilized for hierarchical data organization, potentially for more complex 
account management scenarios.
3. Create the Bank Class: Develop the main class that will use the a for mentioned data 
structures to handle various banking operations. This class will serve as the central point for 
managing accounts and transactions.
4. Account Management Methods: Add functionality to the Bank class for:
o Adding New Accounts: Use account numbers and initial balances to create and store 
new accounts within the system.
o Handling Transfers and Balance Checks: Implement methods to transfer funds 
between accounts and check account balances using account numbers and specified 
amounts.
Overall, the Express Banking System project is designed to offer a streamlined and reliable approach 
to managing banking operations, leveraging modern JavaScript capabilities and data structure Principles.
